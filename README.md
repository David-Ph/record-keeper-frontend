# What's the progress on this project?

I've decided to no longer work on this project because I've learnt a lot more about react and react best practices since I started it, and I'd need to rebuild this project from scratch if I were to continue it.

# What is this project meant to be?

I started this project because I wanted to test my react knowledge after learning a react course.

# What is this project?

During our DnD session, we notice that most of the note taking app doesn't quite fit our needs, that's why I started building this.
